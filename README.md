# non-euclidean_VR

Non-euclidean VR

Based on the ray marching hyperbolic virtual reality simulation (for mobile devices) by Henry Segerman and Michael Woodard at https://github.com/mtwoodard/hypVR-Ray_m,
which is in turn based on the full simulation at https://github.com/mtwoodard/hypVR-Ray. 

The intention is that this version is as independent of the underlying geometry as possible. Different branches of this project will simulate different geometries, e.g. the other eight Thurston geometries.
